Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
